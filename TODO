Roadmap (next on the priorities list):

1) Fix the validation schema:
    -- The only thing that needs to be done here is to fix the schema in the resources dir
       then uncomment the code in the data_handler.py class so that every lookup performs
       a validation.

2) Make the connection to redis reusable:
    -- This is needed to reduce the number of running connections as with the current
       implementation we will always create a new connection when calling an endpoint

3) TEST TEST TEST

4) Add makefile, changelog
